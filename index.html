          <h2>My Goals for the next 2years in the tech field</h2>
          <li>
            <b>Master Advanced JavaScript Frameworks:</b> My goal is to become
            proficient in advanced JavaScript frameworks such as React, Angular,
            and Vue.js. I will focus on deepening my understanding of their core
            concepts, best practices, and how to build complex applications
            using these technologies.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Improve UI/UX Design Skills: </b>Enhancing my skills in user interface
            (UI) and user experience (UX) design is a priority. I plan to learn
            more about design principles and tools like Figma and Sketch, aiming
            to create intuitive and visually appealing interfaces.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Contribute to Open Source Projects:</b> Engaging with the open-source
            community is an important goal. I will contribute to popular
            projects, collaborate with other developers, and learn from their
            feedback. This will help me improve my coding skills and give back
            to the community.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Enhance Performance Optimization Techniques: </b>Performance is crucial
            in web development. I aim to master techniques for optimizing
            website performance, including reducing load times, optimizing
            images, and leveraging browser caching. This will ensure that the
            applications I build are fast and efficient.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Stay Updated with Emerging Technologies The tech field is constantly
                evolving:</b>
             My goal is to stay abreast of the latest trends and
            technologies, such as Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), WebAssembly, and
            AI integrations. Continuous learning and adaptation will keep me
            competitive and innovative in my career.
